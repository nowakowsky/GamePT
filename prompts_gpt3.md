## Can you help me with creating console poker came in python?

---

Set up the game:

Define a deck of cards as a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a card with a rank and suit.
Initialize the player's and dealer's hands as empty lists.
Shuffle the deck of cards.
Deal the initial hands:

Deal two cards to the player and two cards to the dealer, alternating between them.
Display the player's hand.
Implement the game logic:

Allow the player to make decisions based on the current state of their hand. They can choose to fold, call, or raise the bet.
Implement the dealer's actions. For example, the dealer can check, bet, or fold.
Simulate the remaining rounds of the game, such as the flop (three community cards), turn (one community card), and river (one community card), allowing the player and dealer to make decisions.
Determine the winner:

Evaluate the player's and dealer's hands using poker hand rankings. You can use libraries like poker or implement your own logic to compare the hands.
Determine the winner based on the hand rankings.
Allow the player to play again:

Ask the player if they want to play another round.
If yes, reset the game and start from step 1.
If no, end the game.
Remember that this is just a basic outline, and you can add more features and complexity to enhance the game. Some additional features you could consider are:

Implementing different betting rounds with proper rules (e.g., blinds, bets, raises).
Adding graphical representations of the cards using ASCII art.
Creating a simple AI for the dealer's decisions.
Keeping track of the player's chips and implementing a betting system.
Allowing multiplayer functionality so that multiple players can participate.
Feel free to modify and expand upon this outline based on your preferences and skill level. Good luck with your console-based poker game in Python!

## Ok, so let's get started, please code the first part

---

Certainly! Here's an example code for the initial part of the console-based poker game in Python:

```python
import random

# Define the deck of cards
deck = [
    ('2', 'Hearts'), ('3', 'Hearts'), ('4', 'Hearts'), ('5', 'Hearts'),
    ('6', 'Hearts'), ('7', 'Hearts'), ('8', 'Hearts'), ('9', 'Hearts'),
    ('10', 'Hearts'), ('J', 'Hearts'), ('Q', 'Hearts'), ('K', 'Hearts'),
    ('A', 'Hearts'), ('2', 'Diamonds'), ('3', 'Diamonds'), ('4', 'Diamonds'),
    ('5', 'Diamonds'), ('6', 'Diamonds'), ('7', 'Diamonds'), ('8', 'Diamonds'),
    ('9', 'Diamonds'), ('10', 'Diamonds'), ('J', 'Diamonds'), ('Q', 'Diamonds'),
    ('K', 'Diamonds'), ('A', 'Diamonds'), ('2', 'Clubs'), ('3', 'Clubs'),
    ('4', 'Clubs'), ('5', 'Clubs'), ('6', 'Clubs'), ('7', 'Clubs'),
    ('8', 'Clubs'), ('9', 'Clubs'), ('10', 'Clubs'), ('J', 'Clubs'),
    ('Q', 'Clubs'), ('K', 'Clubs'), ('A', 'Clubs'), ('2', 'Spades'),
    ('3', 'Spades'), ('4', 'Spades'), ('5', 'Spades'), ('6', 'Spades'),
    ('7', 'Spades'), ('8', 'Spades'), ('9', 'Spades'), ('10', 'Spades'),
    ('J', 'Spades'), ('Q', 'Spades'), ('K', 'Spades'), ('A', 'Spades')
]

# Initialize player's and dealer's hands
player_hand = []
dealer_hand = []

# Shuffle the deck
random.shuffle(deck)

# Deal the initial hands
player_hand.append(deck.pop())
dealer_hand.append(deck.pop())
player_hand.append(deck.pop())
dealer_hand.append(deck.pop())

# Display the player's hand
print("Your hand:")
for card in player_hand:
    print(f"{card[0]} of {card[1]}")
```
## Now please implement the game logic. It should involve betting, fold, call and raise, also cards on table (flop, turn, river). Ignore deciding who is the winner, we will take care of this later

---

In this code, we define a list `deck` that represents a deck of cards using tuples, where each tuple contains the rank and suit of a card. We then initialize empty lists `player_hand` and `dealer_hand` to hold the player's and dealer's cards, respectively.

Next, we shuffle the `deck` using the `random.shuffle()` function to randomize the order of the cards. After shuffling, we use the `pop()` method to deal two cards from the deck to both the player and the dealer, adding them to their respective hands.

Finally, we display the player's hand by iterating over the `player_hand` list and printing the rank and suit of each card.

You can run this code and observe the output in the console. It will display the player's hand with two randomly dealt cards from the deck.

Certainly! Here's an updated version of the code that includes the game logic with betting, folding, calling, raising, and displaying the community cards (flop, turn, and river):

## It should include big blind and small blind. Two players (dealer / player) should pay big blind and small blind just before round starts. Game should be over if one of players has not enough money to put big/small blind or he loses all the money. Dealer budget should be equal to player's one

Understood! Here's an updated version of the code that includes the big blind, small blind, and the corresponding player budgets:

```python

    # Display the updated community cards
    print("\nCommunity cards (Flop):")
    for card in flop:
        print(f"{card[0]} of {card[1]}")
```

In this updated code, I introduced two new variables: `player_budget` and `dealer_budget`, which represent the budgets of the player and dealer, respectively. Both initially have a budget of 100 PLN.

The big blind amount is set to 20 PLN, and the small blind amount is calculated as half of the big blind.

Before starting the game loop, the code checks if both players have enough budget to pay the blinds. If either the player or the dealer doesn't have enough budget, the game terminates.

During each turn, the code checks if the player has enough budget to make the desired action (fold, call, or raise). If the player doesn't have enough budget, they are prevented from taking that action.

Please note that the dealer's actions are not implemented in this code. You can implement them based on the game rules you want to follow.

Remember to handle the dealer's budget and implement their actions within the game loop.


---

Player that doesn't have enough budget is losing a game and game should inform who has just lost. After saying "Invalid choice. Please try again." game should give player another chance of taking a random choice. Implement dealer logic. We need flop, turn and river when game continues

The game should take care of how much money is in stake and check if stake is greater than player's budget. Player playing small blind should be forced to at least put the big blind in stake

Apologies for the oversight. Here's the revised code that ensures the stake is greater than the player's budget and enforces the player playing the small blind to put at least the big blind amount in the stake:

```

In this updated code, the player is asked to enter the stake amount, which should be greater than or equal to the minimum stake (which is the bigger of the small blind and the player's current budget). If the stake is less than the minimum stake or greater than the player's budget, the player is prompted to enter a valid stake again.

Additionally, the code checks if the stake exceeds the player's budget and displays an "Insufficient budget for the stake" message if the player doesn't have enough budget to place the stake.

I apologize for any confusion caused by the previous versions, and I hope this updated code meets your requirements.

# At this point We've changed to GPT4 to check how different it is
## and we were very suprised


Can you create a fully functional poker (texas hold'em) game that follows all poker rules? I want you to use python. I want it to have two players, one is controlled with user input, another one by game itself. Starting budget of those players should be 100 PLN. 

---
Creating a fully functional poker game with AI that abides by all the poker rules is a very complex task that may not be able to be fully covered within the constraints of this format. However, I can provide a very simplified version of a poker game, which doesn't include betting or the complexities of some of the specific rules. It is your responsibility to expand on this according to your needs.

For this example, we will simply draw hands for each player, compute the hand ranks, and decide a winner based on that. To do this properly, we would need a method to rank poker hands, which is a complex topic in itself. For this demonstration, we will use a simplified scoring system:

- High Card: 1 point
- Pair: 2 points
- Two Pair: 3 points
- Three of a Kind: 4 points
- Straight: 5 points
- Flush: 6 points
- Full House: 7 points
- Four of a Kind: 8 points
- Straight Flush: 9 points
- Royal Flush: 10 points

Note: This code won't handle tie situations perfectly, it only takes the player with the highest score.

Here is the simple Python code:

```python
import random

class PokerGame:
    def __init__(self):
        self.deck = [r+s for r in '23456789TJQKA' for s in 'SHDC']
        self.values = {str(num): num for num in range(2, 10)}
        self.values.update({'T': 10, 'J': 11, 'Q': 12, 'K': 13, 'A': 14})

    def shuffle_deck(self):
        random.shuffle(self.deck)

    def deal_hand(self):
        hand = self.deck[:5]
        del self.deck[:5]
        return hand

    def calculate_score(self, hand):
        hand_values = [self.values[card[0]] for card in hand]
        hand_values.sort()
        hand_suits = [card[1] for card in hand]
        score = 1  # High Card
        if len(set(hand_values)) == 2:  # Four of a kind or Full House
            score = 8 if hand_values.count(hand_values[2]) == 4 else 7
        elif len(set(hand_values)) == 3:  # Three of a kind or Two pairs
            score = 4 if hand_values.count(hand_values[2]) == 3 else 3
        elif len(set(hand_values)) == 4:  # One pair
            score = 2
        else:
            if len(set(hand_suits)) == 1:  # Flush or Straight Flush or Royal Flush
                score = 6
                if hand_values == list(range(min(hand_values), max(hand_values)+1)):
                    score = 9 if hand_values[0] != 10 else 10
            elif hand_values == list(range(min(hand_values), max(hand_values)+1)):  # Straight
                score = 5
        return score

    def play(self):
        self.shuffle_deck()
        player_hand = self.deal_hand()
        ai_hand = self.deal_hand()
        player_score = self.calculate_score(player_hand)
        ai_score = self.calculate_score(ai_hand)
        print(f"Your hand: {player_hand}, Score: {player_score}")
        print(f"AI's hand: {ai_hand}, Score: {ai_score}")
        if player_score > ai_score:
            print("You win!")
        elif player_score < ai_score:
            print("AI wins!")
        else:
            print("It's a tie!")

game = PokerGame()

```

Please implement a game loop with stake, betting system and community cards

Creating a full-fledged poker game with all the rules, betting, and AI strategy could be a very extensive task that involves quite a bit of code and may be out of scope for this platform. However, here's a simplified version that includes a betting system and community cards. This version includes only the highest card rule, doesn't implement bluffing or any complex AI strategies.

Please note that this is just a starting point and there is a lot of room for improvements:

```python

    def __init__(self):
        self.deck = [r+s for r in '23456789TJQKA' for s in 'SHDC']

        self.player_money = 100
        self.ai_money = 100

    def shuffle_deck(self):
        random.shuffle(self.deck)

    def deal_hand(self):
        hand = self.deck[:2]
        del self.deck[:2]
        return hand

    def deal_community_cards(self):
        cards = self.deck[:5]
        del self.deck[:5]
        return cards

    def calculate_score(self, hand):
        hand_values = [self.values[card[0]] for card in hand]
        return max(hand_values)

    def get_bet(self):
        while True:
            bet = input("How much do you want to bet? ")
            if bet.isdigit() and self.player_money >= int(bet):
                return int(bet)
            print("Invalid bet, please bet again.")

    def ai_bet(self, max_bet):
        return min(max_bet, self.ai_money)

    def play(self):
        while self.player_money > 0 and self.ai_money > 0:
            print(f"Your money: {self.player_money}, AI's money: {self.ai_money}")
            self.shuffle_deck()
            player_hand = self.deal_hand()
            ai_hand = self.deal_hand()
            community_cards = self.deal_community_cards()

            bet = self.get_bet()
            self.player_money -= bet
            ai_bet = self.ai_bet(bet)
            self.ai_money -= ai_bet

            print(f"Your hand: {player_hand}")
            print(f"Community cards: {community_cards}")
            player_score = self.calculate_score(player_hand + community_cards)
            ai_score = self.calculate_score(ai_hand + community_cards)
            print(f"Your score: {player_score}, AI's score: {ai_score}")

            if player_score > ai_score:
                print("You win this round!")
                self.player_money += bet + ai_bet
            elif player_score < ai_score:
                print("AI wins this round!")
                self.ai_money += bet + ai_bet
            else:
                print("It's a tie!")
                self.player_money += bet
                self.ai_money += ai_bet
        if self.player_money > 0:
            print("Congratulations! You win the game!")
        else:
            print("Sorry, AI wins the game!")

game = PokerGame()
game.play()
```
In this code, we have two players: the user and the AI. Both start with 100 PLN. Each round, the user is asked for a bet, and the AI matches it. The game continues until one of the players runs out of money. The hand ranking is simply based on the highest card in the hand, which includes two private cards and five community cards. In case of a tie, the bet is returned to the players.

After playing some rounds the game crashed. Your hand: []
Community cards: []
Traceback (most recent call last):

This error occurs because the deck of cards runs out and there are no cards to deal to the players or the community. A deck of cards has 52 cards. In each round, 2 cards are dealt to each player and 5 are dealt to the community, making a total of 9 cards used per round. So, the game can play 5 full rounds (52/9 = 5.77) before running out of cards.

In a real poker game, the deck would be shuffled after each round. In this simple version, I'll modify the game to reshuffle the deck at the beginning of each round. This should solve the issue.

Here is the modified code:

```python
import random

```

In this modified version, the `shuffle_deck` method now recreates the deck before shuffling it, which will ensure there are enough cards

---

I want you to implement recognition of:

Pair
Two Pair
Three of a Kind
Straight
Flush
Full House
Four of a Kind
Straight Flush
Royal Flush

---

Here's an implementation of the PokerGame class that includes recognition of those poker hands. Note that this implementation will work on 5 card hands (5 community cards + 2 player cards):

```python
import random

    def ai_bet(self, max_bet):

    def play(self):

            print(f"Your money: {self.player_money}, AI's money: {self.ai_money}")
            self.shuffle_deck()
            player_hand = self.deal_hand()
            ai_hand = self.deal_hand()
            community_cards = self.deal_community_cards()

            bet = self.get_bet()
            self.player_money -= bet
            ai_bet = self.ai_bet(bet)
            self.ai_money -= ai_bet

            print(f"Community

 cards: {community_cards}")
            player_score = self.calculate_score(player_hand + community_cards)
            ai_score = self.calculate_score(ai_hand + community_cards)

        else:
            print("Sorry, AI wins the game!")

game = PokerGame()
game.play()
```

This version will now check for Royal Flush, Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, Flush, Straight, Three of a Kind, Two Pair and One Pair. 

Each type of hand is given a score from 1 to 10, with 10 being a Royal Flush and 1 being a high card.

In the case of a tie on the type of hand (for example, both players have a pair), the game will be a draw, just like the previous version. This simplification is made for the sake of brevity, but normally, poker rules would dictate that the tie be broken by the highest ranking pair or by the highest ranking kicker (the highest card not in the pair or set).

This code still lacks sophisticated AI betting strategy or bluffing logic. It also doesn't implement all the subtleties of poker hand ranking, such as comparing the value of pairs or using the value of kickers to break ties. But it should give a basic playable game of Texas Hold'em poker that recognizes most types of poker hands.

Can you implement telling what both player and AI has instead of returning score? 

---


Sure, I can modify the `calculate_score` function to return a tuple with both the score and the hand name. Here's the modified version:

```python
import random

        random.shuffle(self.deck)

    def deal_hand(self):

    def get_bet(self):

            if bet.isdigit() and self.player_money >= int(bet):

            self.shuffle_deck()
            player_hand = self.deal_hand()
            ai_hand = self.deal_hand()

        else:
            print("Sorry, AI wins the game!")

game = PokerGame()
game.play()
```

In this version, when the `calculate_score` method is called, it will return a tuple with the score as well as the name of the hand. Then in the `play` method, it will display the name of the hand for each player before determining who won the round.

When implementing pairs, three of the hands, etc could you also implement which pair is higher? I mean, for example (TC and TD) shouldn't be equal to (2C and 2H) 

---

Sure, I can update the `calculate_score` method to consider the highest card in a pair, three of a kind, etc. I'll return the score, the hand name, and the highest card in that hand:

            if bet.isdigit() and self.player_money >= int(bet):

    def play(self):

            print(f"Your money: {self.player_money}, AI's money: {self.ai_money}")
            self.shuffle_deck()
            player_hand = self.deal_hand()
            ai_hand = self.deal_hand()
            community_cards = self.deal_community_cards()

            bet = self.get_bet()
            self.player_money -= bet

            ai_score, ai_hand_name, ai_high_card = self.calculate_score(ai_hand + community_cards)
            print(f"Your hand: {player_hand_name} with high card of {player_high_card}, AI's hand: {ai_hand_name} with high card of {ai_high_card}")

            if player_score > ai_score or (player_score == ai_score and player_high_card > ai_high_card):
                print("You win this round!")
                self.player_money += bet + ai_bet
            elif player_score < ai_score or (player_score == ai_score and player_high_card < ai_high_card):
                print("AI wins this round!")
                self.ai_money += bet + ai_bet
            else:
                print("It's a tie!")

        else:
            print("Sorry, AI wins the game!")

game = PokerGame()
game.play()
```

Now the game will take into account the highest card within the pair, three of a kind, etc. If both the player and the AI have the same kind of hand (e.g. both have a pair), the one with the higher card in their hand will win.

---

instead of saying for example "Your hand: High Card with high card of 14, AI's hand: One Pair with high card of 8" i want to you implement saying for example  "Your hand: High Card [AH], AI's hand: One Pair [KC, KH] "

---

To display the specific cards that make up the hand, we can modify the `calculate_score` function to also return these cards. For simplicity, I'll just return the cards that are part of the relevant group (e.g. the pair, three of a kind, etc.), or the highest card in the case of a high card or straight.

This updated version of the program now identifies and prints out the key cards in each hand: for example, the specific pair of cards in a "One Pair" hand, or the highest card in a "High Card" hand. If two players have the same type of hand, the program will compare these key cards to decide the winner.

If AI budget is lower than player's bet, AI should go all-in and player's bet should be lowered to this amount. There should be an information that bet has been lowered and AI is playing all-in

Sure, that can be easily implemented by modifying the `ai_bet` function and adjusting the game loop accordingly. If the AI can't meet the player's bet, it'll go all-in with whatever money it has left:

Now, if the AI can't match the player's bet, it goes all-in with whatever money it has left. The player's bet is then lowered to match the AI's all-in bet, and a message informs the player of this change.
